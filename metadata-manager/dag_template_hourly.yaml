    Brief description of what this hourly DAG does.

    Include:
    - Data sources (where data comes from)
    - Purpose (what tables/metrics it produces, why hourly is needed)
    - Important notes (data freshness requirements, dependencies, timing)
  default_args:
    owner: <owner_email>@mozilla.com
    start_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # When to start processing
    email:
      - "telemetry-alerts@mozilla.com"
      - "<owner_email>@mozilla.com"
      # Add team emails if applicable
    retries: 2  # Hourly DAGs often need more retries for transient issues
    retry_delay: 15m  # 15-minute retry for hourly schedules
  tags:
    - impact/tier_1  # Hourly DAGs are often critical for real-time monitoring
  # Optional: Enable catchup if historical hourly data is needed
  # catchup: true

# Common schedule variations for hourly DAGs:
# 30 * * * *   - Every hour at :30 (recommended, allows for data availability)
# 0 * * * *    - Every hour at :00 (top of the hour)
# */2 * * * *  - Every 2 hours
# 15 * * * *   - Every hour at :15
