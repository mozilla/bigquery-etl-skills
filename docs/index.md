# BigQuery ETL Skills

A comprehensive Claude Code plugin that accelerates development workflows on Mozilla's [bigquery-etl](https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl) repository using [Claude Code Skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512176-what-are-skills). 


!!! note "Designed for bigquery-etl"
    These skills work best when launched from your local development environment within the [bigquery-etl](https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl) repository.

## What are Skills?

Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way.
