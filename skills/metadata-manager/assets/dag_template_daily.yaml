    Brief description of what this DAG does.

    Include:

    - Purpose (what tables/metrics it produces)
    - Important notes (dependencies, known issues, timing considerations)
  default_args:

    start_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # When to start processing (e.g., "2024-01-01")
    email:
      - "telemetry-alerts@mozilla.com"
      - "<owner_email>@mozilla.com"
      # Add team emails if applicable

    retry_delay: 10m
  tags:
