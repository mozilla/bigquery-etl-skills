    Brief description of what this DAG does.

    Include:
    - Data sources (where data comes from)
    - Purpose (what tables/metrics it produces)
    - Why this specific schedule? (business requirements, data availability)
    - Important notes (dependencies, known issues, timing considerations)
  default_args:
    owner: <owner_email>@mozilla.com
    start_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # When to start processing
    email:
      - "telemetry-alerts@mozilla.com"
      - "<owner_email>@mozilla.com"
      # Add team emails if applicable
    retries: 1  # Adjust based on reliability needs
    retry_delay: 10m  # Adjust based on schedule frequency
  tags:
    - impact/tier_2  # tier_1 (critical), tier_2 (important), tier_3 (nice-to-have)
  # Optional: Uncomment if needed
  # catchup: true  # Enable backfilling for historical data
  # depends_on_past: true  # Require previous run to succeed

# Common custom schedule patterns:

# INTERVAL SCHEDULES (simpler format):
# 3h     - Every 3 hours
# 6h     - Every 6 hours
# 12h    - Every 12 hours
# 30m    - Every 30 minutes

# CRON SCHEDULES (more control):
# 0 0 * * 0       - Weekly on Sunday at midnight
# 0 0 * * 1       - Weekly on Monday at midnight
# 0 0 1 * *       - Monthly on the 1st at midnight
# 0 */6 * * *     - Every 6 hours at :00
# 0 0,12 * * *    - Twice daily at midnight and noon
# 0 2 * * 1-5     - Weekdays only at 2 AM
# 0 0 15 * *      - Monthly on the 15th at midnight

# EXAMPLES:

# Weekly reporting DAG:
# schedule_interval: 0 2 * * 1  # Monday at 2 AM

# Every 3 hours:
# schedule_interval: 3h

# Monthly aggregation:
# schedule_interval: 0 0 1 * *  # 1st of month at midnight

# Twice daily:
# schedule_interval: 0 2,14 * * *  # 2 AM and 2 PM
