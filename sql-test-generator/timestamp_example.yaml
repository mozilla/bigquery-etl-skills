# ❌ WRONG FORMATS - These will cause test failures:
# - campaign_created_at: "2025-06-01 10:00:00"  # Missing 'T' and timezone
# - campaign_created_at: "06/01/2025 10:00:00"  # Wrong date format
# - campaign_created_at: "2025-06-01"  # Missing time portion for TIMESTAMP

# Format rules:
# - TIMESTAMP/DATETIME: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00" (ISO 8601)
# - DATE: "YYYY-MM-DD"
# - With microseconds: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff+00:00"
