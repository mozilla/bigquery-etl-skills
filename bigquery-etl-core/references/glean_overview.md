# Glean Dictionary Overview

URL: https://dictionary.telemetry.mozilla.org

The Glean Dictionary provides a comprehensive index of datasets generated by applications built using the Glean SDKs.

## What is Glean

- Mozilla's product analytics & telemetry solution
- Provides consistent measurement across all Mozilla products
- Different from Firefox Desktop Telemetry (legacy system)
- Uses metric types and pings to send structured data
- Enforces data review and expiration dates for all metrics
- Auto-generates documentation for metrics

## Key Concepts

- **Glean SDK**: Performs measurements and sends data from products
- **Metric types**: Predefined measurement types (counter, boolean, string, event, etc.)
- **Pings**: Collections of metrics sent over the network (e.g., `baseline`, `events`, `metrics`)
- **Applications**: Products using Glean (e.g., Fenix, Focus, Firefox iOS)

## Common Glean Datasets in BigQuery

- Pattern: `{app_id}.{ping_name}` (e.g., `org_mozilla_fenix.baseline`, `org_mozilla_fenix.events`)
- Common pings: `baseline`, `events`, `metrics`, `deletion_request`
- All have automatically generated schemas based on metric definitions

## When to Reference

- Working with Glean-based applications (Fenix, Focus, Firefox iOS, etc.)
- Understanding available metrics for a Glean application
- Looking up metric definitions, types, and expiration dates
- Finding which pings contain specific metrics
- Understanding Glean dataset structures
